The following changes have been made to the geometry:
-- A model for the beam profiler has been added just after the entrance of the 
beam pipe to the collimator cave.  This consists of a lead sheet as a converter
and two layers of scintillating fibers.
-- The 1x10^-3 pair converter was put in the beam line just before the pair 
spectrometer magnet.
-- A 1 cm thick piece of scintillator (active target) was placed downstream of the beam pipe in the hall before the commissioning target assembly.
-- The 2 mm thick plastic target was replaced with a 1 cm thick plastic target
